Universal_EMACS
===============

Call to action!  We want universal Emacs/Cocoa-like functionality!

I'm a vim guy but if your anything like me you still find the ctrl-[fbnpae] shortcuts indespensible, and when they don't work... well that's simply a damn shame.

Demands:
ctrl-[fbnp] sends the equivalent <right> <left> <down> <up> keystrokes universally.
-finder navigation
-anywhere up/down selection is possible (i.e. in google search results, ctrl-[np] should behave exactly as arrow keys)
-Anywhere the bindings are not natively supported (*tsk tsk* Adobe apps... congratulations to the Edge team for being better.
